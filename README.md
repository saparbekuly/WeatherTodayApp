# Weather Today App
This app provides current weather updates from the OpenWeatherMap API for user-specified locations, refreshing data every 10 minutes to ensure accuracy

## Description

This Android app is developed using Jetpack Compose, integrating contemporary libraries and frameworks to elevate the user experience. It utilizes Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations and Koin for dependency injection, ensuring streamlined code management. The app adopts the MVI architecture, enhanced with LiveData and ViewModel for robust UI data handling, Room for persistent data storage, and Retrofit for efficient network communication
